. 🏰 Kingdom Architect (Strategy/Management)
Concept: Build a medieval kingdom from scratch, but you're cursed - everything you build slowly decays. Balance construction vs. maintenance.

Core Loop:

Place buildings (farms, houses, walls, markets)
Citizens generate resources automatically
Buildings degrade over time (visual decay effects)
Unlock upgrades to slow decay
Random events (dragon attacks, plagues, festivals)
Prestige system: Rebuild kingdom with bonuses
Unique Twist: Time reversal mechanic - spend mana to rewind time for specific buildings

2. 🌊 Ocean Depths Tycoon (Incremental/Discovery)

Deploy submarines to different ocean zones
Each depth has unique creatures/resources
Upgrade subs (speed, capacity, depth rating)
Research discoveries for permanent bonuses
Pressure/oxygen management
Random encounters (giant squid, shipwrecks, underwater ruins)
Unique Twist: Bioluminescent creatures create "light currency" - deeper = more valuable but riskier

Concept: Combine ingredients to create potions. Each potion has side effects that affect your shop/town.

Core Loop:

Customers request potions
